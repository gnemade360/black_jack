Blackjack (21) Python Game
Introduction
Welcome to the Blackjack Python Game! This program is a text-based implementation of the popular card game Blackjack, also known as 21. In this game, the player competes against a computer dealer. The goal is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it, or "busting."

How to Play
Run the program by executing the Python script blackjack.py.
The game will begin with the player and the dealer receiving two random cards each.
The player's hand will be shown, along with the dealer's face-up card.
The player's turn starts, and they will be prompted to choose between "Hit" or "Stand":
Hit (H): Draw an additional card to increase the hand value.
Stand (S): Keep the current hand value and end the player's turn.
If the player's hand value exceeds 21 after choosing to Hit, the player loses immediately.
After the player's turn, the dealer will play automatically based on predefined rules:
The dealer will keep drawing cards until their hand value is at least 17.
Once the dealer's turn is over, the winner will be determined:
If either the player or dealer's hand value exceeds 21, the other party wins.
If both the player and dealer have hand values below 21, the one closest to 21 wins.
In case of a tie, the game ends in a draw.
